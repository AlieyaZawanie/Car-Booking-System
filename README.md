 # A Car Booking System
 
 The system is about the car rental service. This Car Rental System is designed to aid the car
 rental company to enable renting cars through an online system. It helps the users to search for
 available vehicles and book the cars for the time being. It has a user-friendly interface which
 allows the user to choose cars and rent them for the period specified. The use of internet
 technology has made it easy for customers to rent a car at any time. This Car Rental System
 makes bookings easy. It saves time and labour. The primary purpose of this system is to provide
 a valuable and beneficial system to the client. All requirements are required for client
 applications. As such, the system collects information from the user, and the client can monitor
 the vehicle they want to book and book transaction information.
 
 For customers to book the car, they must have an account to book for it. They must register and
 fill in the form for the system to get their valid information, such as email, identification number,
 password, full name, address, contact number and license number. After the customer registers
 with the system, they can log in to their account by entering their identification number and
 password that has been made previously. After login in, they can view lists of cars and fill in the
 booking form according to their desired car and the pickup and return date of the vehicle. After
 booking the car, they can view the status of the booking car to see whether their application is
 approved or rejected. They must wait 1-3 working days for an admin to verify their bookings.
 The customer can also modify the rental date and cancel the booking. If the customer has many
 booking lists, they can search for their booking by entering their booking ID to check the car
 status, so they don't have to scroll. Lastly, customer can update their profile according to their
 needs.
 
 Using this system, the admin can verify the rental status, add the vehicle, modify/update the
 current information about the vehicle, search for customer's booking, and view lists of bookings
 that have not been approved and one that has been approved. The car information can be added
 to the system by the admin, and it can be viewed by the customer to rent out. The updated
 information about the vehicle that has been modified will also be displayed on the customerâ€™s
 screen
